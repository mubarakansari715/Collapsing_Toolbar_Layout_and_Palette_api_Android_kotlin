    <string name="app_context">This Ajmer shrine is among the most important pilgrimage sites in India. It was the abode of the Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chishti between 1192 and 1236 AD, and contains his tomb. The shrine was constructed by Mughal emperor Humayun, while subsequent rulers such as Akbar and Shah Jahan also built mosques in the complex. Moinuddin Chishti’s marble tomb lies at the centre of the complex, and is surrounded by a marble screen. Traditional offerings include flowers, a ‘chadar’ and sweets. If you have time, make sure you attend a ‘qawwali’ (musical performance) at the dargah, usually held on every Thursday and Friday evening. These melodious performances include verses sung in praise of the Prophet and various Sufi saints.</string>
